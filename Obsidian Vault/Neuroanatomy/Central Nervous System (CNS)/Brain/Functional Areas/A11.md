> Together with the four main pathways, [[nigrostriatal]], [[mesolimbic]], [[mesocortical]], and [[tuberoinfundibular]], there is another diencephalic [[dopamine|dopaminergic]] cluster in the dorsal posterior [[hypothalamus]] named [[A11]] region

> The loss of [[A11]] neurons causes a disinhibition of sensory inputs and favors the occurrence of abnormal visceral or muscular sensations (Clemens et al. 2006). Impairment of [[A11]] neurons are related with restless legs syndrome, which is conceptualized as abnormal limbs sensations that diminish with motor activity, has a circadian period and peaks at the evening, leading to disrupted sleep (Winkelman 1999; Bara-Jimenez et al. 2000; Clemens et al. 2006).

> circuits, possibly leading to an imbalance of the descending control of the sympathetic pre-ganglionic and further focal akathisia, therefore contributing to restless legs syndrome (Clemens et al. 2006).
