> Anomalous basal ganglia morphology may contribute to deficient motor response control in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

> High resolution T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE images covering the whole brain were acquired for all participants on a 3 T scanner.

> deformation (compression) on the dorsal surface of the globus pallidus and within subregions of the putamen receiving projections from limbic, executive and motor cortices were observed in boys, but not girls, with ADHD relative to TD children.

> putamen and globus pallidus volumes mediated the relationship between diagnosis and commission error rate.

> reduced volumes of these structures and localized inward deformation within executive and motor circuits correlated with poorer response control, particularly under conditions of increased cognitive load.

> Dopamine-related abnormalities in the basal ganglia have been implicated in attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

> reduced brain iron and serum ferritin levels have been linked to ADHD symptom severity in children.

> basal ganglia is a central brain region implicated in ADHD psychopathology and involved in motor and reward functions as well as emotional responding.

> We observed reduced iron levels in children with ADHD in the bilateral limbic region of the striatum, as well as reduced levels of iron-deposition in males in the sensorimotor

> Thus, we estimated intrinsic DA availability using magnetic resonance-based assessments of basal ganglia and thalamic tissue iron in 36 medication-naïve children with ADHD and 29 typically developing (TD) children (8–12 y) who underwent fMRI scans and completed standard and rewarded go/no-go tasks.

> higher putamen tissue iron was associated with worse response inhibition performance in all participants
