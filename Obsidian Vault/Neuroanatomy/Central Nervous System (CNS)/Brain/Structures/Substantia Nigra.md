> Dopamine quinones are short-lived toxic species that readily form covalent bonds with cellular macromolecules (Stokes et al. 1999). The dopamine quinone can also undergo intramolecular cyclization to aminochrome which polymerizes and forms neuromelanin, the dark pigment contained in the dopaminergic neurons found in the substantia nigra pars compacta

> Neuromelanin is formed in dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta due to the levels of VMAT-2 which are lower than mes- olimbic system (Segura-Aguilar et al. 2014), leading to an inverse relationship between VMAT-2 expression level and neuromelanin content in human midbrain dopaminergic neurons (Liang et al. 2004).
