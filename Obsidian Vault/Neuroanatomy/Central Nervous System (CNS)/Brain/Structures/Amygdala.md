> The same team found some subcortical regions of the brain, i.e., basal ganglia, amygdala, hippocampus, and intracranial volumes were smaller in children with ADHD in 23 cohorts of 3242 participants. The differences seen in children were not seen in adolescents or adults (Hoogman et al., 2017, 2019). All of the differences observed were small to very small and subtle.

> D1-like receptors are mostly found in the cau- date–putamen (striatum), nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra pars reticulata, olfactory bulb, amygdala, and frontal cortex (Savasta et al. 1986; Wamsley et al. 1989).

> D2-like receptors are mainly expressed in striatum, the lateral part of the globus pallidus, core of the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, hypothalamus, amygdala, cortical areas, hip- pocampus, and pituitary (Wamsley et al. 1989; Yokoyama et al. 1994).

> The VTA region is also the origin of dopaminergic projections to the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and olfactory bulb (Fallon and Moore 1978; Loughlin and Fallon 1983; Gasbarri et al. 1997; Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado 2002; Otmakhova et al. 2013).

> We found an imaging-based double dissociation in amygdala activation in patients with ADHD and severe mood dysregulation. Nonirritable ADHD youths showed amygdala hyperactivity when completing subjective fear ratings of neutral faces relative to healthy youths and those with bipolar disorder or severe mood dysregula- tion. In contrast, children with chronic irritability (op- erationalized using Leibenluft et al.’s criteria for severe mood dysregulation [1]) showed amygdala hypoactivity relative to healthy youths and those with bipolar disor- der or ADHD.

> ADHD subjects in the present sample were evaluated carefully to ensure that they did not have significant ir- ritability or other mood symptoms. Thus, it is somewhat surprising that the ADHD children demonstrated amyg- dala hyperactivity during a face processing task. However, studies demonstrate structural (32) and dopaminergic (33) abnormalities in the amygdala in ADHD patients, suggesting that amygdala abnormalities in ADHD are not without precedent.
