> [[Dopamine]] neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] that project to the [[striatum]] form the [[nigrostriatal]] pathway (Fig. 2b), which has a role in the control of motor function and learning capabilities (Hikosaka et al. 2002). This pathway controls procedural aspects of movements and motivated behaviors, since it projects to more dorsal [[basal ganglia]] areas where behavioral and cognitive habits are learned and stored (Carli et al. 1985; Graybiel 1997; Haber 2003). The [[nigrostriatal]] dopaminergic system is also involved in central pain modulation, in which inhibition is modulated by D2 receptors

> The modulation of the direct pathway involves the activation of [[subthalamus|subthalamic nucleus]] which can activate the [[dopamine|dopaminergic]] neurons of [[nigrostriatal]] pathway
