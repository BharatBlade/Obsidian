> enhanced [[dopamine|dopaminergic]] function in [[mesolimbic]] system increases behavioral activity, while lesions of this system can eliminate exploratory and appetitive behaviors.

> The [[mesolimbic]] [[dopamine]] pathway is also crucial to the consolidation of maternal memory, when the mothers show enhanced maternal responsiveness toward their infant if they have already had previous maternal experiences.

> The [[mesolimbic]] [[dopamine]] pathway is also crucial to the consolidation of maternal memory, when the mothers show enhanced maternal responsiveness toward their infant if they have already had previous maternal experiences. D1 and D2 [[dopamine]] receptors, especially in the [[nucleus accumbens]] shell, play an important role in this context
