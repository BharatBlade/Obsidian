Synthesized from [[3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL)]] via [[Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH)]]
> 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacet- aldehyde (DOPAL) which is preferentially converted into 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)

Degraded into [[Homovanillic Acid (HVA)]] via [[Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT)]]

> Catechol-O-Methyltrans- ferase (COMT) can further degrade DOPAC into homovan- illic acid (HVA)
