>  A population-based birth cohort study of over 5700 children found no significant differ- ences among children with high, average, or low IQ and ADHD in median age at which ADHD criteria were met, rates of learning disorders, psychiatric disorders, and substance abuse, and rates of stimulant treatment (Katusic et al., 2011; Rommelse et al., 2017).

> Another meta-analysis, with 135 studies and about a quarter of a million youths, found no significant differences in prevalence between North America and Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Oceania (Polanczyk et al., 2014).

> The latter meta-analysis found no increase in the prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents over the past three decades (Polanczyk et al., 2014).

> Three meta-analyses with over twenty studies covering more than three million persons have found prenatal exposure to maternal smoking associated with a greater than 50 % increase in inci- dence of ADHD (Huang et al., 2018a) (Dong et al., 2018; Nilsen and Tulve, 2020). Although this association has also been seen in large population studies (Joelsson et al., 2016; Obel et al., 2016; Skoglund et al., 2014), it disappears after adjusting for family history of ADHD, which indicates that the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and ADHD is due to familial or genetic factors that increase the risk for both smoking and ADHD.
