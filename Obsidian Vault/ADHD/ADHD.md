# Definition
$\qquad$[[ADHD]] is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as a chronic neurodevelopment disorder. It is described as a persistent, functionally debilitating pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity.

## Development and Course
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1. In preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. 
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2. Inattention becomes more prominent during elementary school.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 3. During adolescence, signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running and climbing) are less common and may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of jitteriness, restlessness, or impatience.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 4.  In adulthood, along with inattention and restlessness, impulsivity may remain problematic even when hyperactivity has diminished.

> Some symptoms of [[ADHD]] persist into adolescence and adult life in approximately 80% of children diagnosed with the disorder (Faraone et al. 2003).

# Basic Science
## Neuroanatomy
children with [[ADHD]] present smaller volumes in different subcortical brain regions (i.e., [[nucleus accumbens]], [[amygdala]], [[caudate]], [[Hippocampus]], and [[putamen]]) and total intracranial volume, as well as decreased cortical surface area (mainly in [[Frontal Cortex|frontal]], [[Cingulate Cortex|cingulate]], and [[Temporal Cortex|temporal]] regions) and thickness (in the [[fusiform gyrus]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] pole) [119]. Such alterations are not observed when restricting the analyses to adults and no effects of psychostimulants were found. Through adopting an independent component analysis of whole-brain morphometry images, associations of [[ADHD]] with reduced volumes in [[frontal lobe|frontal]] lobes, [[striatum]], and their interconnecting white matter microstructure were reported for both children and adults, supporting a role of the frontostriatal circuit regardless of age.

## Neurogenetics

> In a human study, Faraone et al. (2005) described that specific genes showed important associations with [[ADHD|ADHD]], and these genes are related to components of the catecholamine signaling system, such as [[Dopamine transporter (DAT)|DAT]], [[norepinephrine]] transporter (NET), D4, and D5 [[dopamine]] receptors (Fig. 1a) (Yang et al. 2004; Faraone et al. 2005; Madras et al. 2005).

> Knockout-[[Dopamine transporter (DAT)|DAT]] mice showed hyperactivity and deficits in inhibitory behavior, two characteristics related to [[ADHD|ADHD]], and hyperactivity decreased when treated with stimulants (Giros et al. 1996; Gainetdinov et al. 1999). Abnormal levels of [[Dopamine transporter (DAT)|DAT]] have also been detected in brains of [[ADHD|ADHD]] patients, and [[Dopamine transporter (DAT)|DAT]] is a target of anti-hyperactivity drugs such as [[amphetamine]] (Madras et al. 2005).
