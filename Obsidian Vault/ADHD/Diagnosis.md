Defined by the DSM-V

> Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities: Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five symptoms are required.

## Symptoms
### Inattention
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1a. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily sidetracked).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones). 
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1h. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1i. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).
### Hyperactivity
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require remaining in place).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.)
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2e. Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2f. Often talks excessively.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2g. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2h. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games, or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiving permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over what others are doing).

> [[ADHD]] is characterized by inattention (daydreaming and distraction), impulsiveness, excessive motor activity, and hyperactivity (Lange et al. 2010; Matthews et al. 2014).

## Diagnostic Criteria
$\qquad$$\qquad$ A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2)
$\qquad$$\qquad$ B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ E. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal).

> The diagnosis requires: 1) the presence of developmentally inappropriate levels of hyperactive-impulsive and/or inattentive symptoms for at least 6 months; 2) symptoms occurring in different settings (e.g., home and school); 3) symptoms that cause impairments in living; 4) some of the symptoms and impairments first occurred in early to mid-childhood; and 4) no other disorder better explains the symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; World Health Organization, 2018; Yi and Jing, 2015).

## Presentations
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1. 314.01 (F90.2) Combined presentation: If both Criterion A1 (inattention) and Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) are met for the past 6 months.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2. 314.00 (F90.0) Predominantly inattentive presentation: If Criterion A1 (inattention) is met but Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is not met for the past 6 months.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 3. 314.01 (F90.1) Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation: If Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is met and Criterion A1 (inattention) is not met for the past 6 months.

> The clinical presentation of [[ADHD]] can be described as primarily inattentive, primarily hyperactive-impulsive, or combined, depending on the nature of their symptoms (American Psychiat- ric Association, 2013). Meta-analyses indicate that inattention is more strongly associated with academic impairment, low self-esteem, negative occupational outcomes, and lower overall adaptive functioning. Hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are associated with peer rejection, aggression, risky driving behaviors, and accidental injuries. Patterns of associated disorders also differ between the dimensions (Willcutt et al., 2012).

## Associated Features
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1. Associated features may include low frustration tolerance, irritability, or mood lability.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2. academic or work performance is often impaired
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 3. By early adulthood, ADHD is associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt, primarily when comorbid with mood, conduct, or substance use disorders.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 4. Reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful control, or constraint; negative emotionality; and/or elevated novelty seeking
