> A meta-analysis comprising 25 studies with over eight million participants found that children and adolescents who are relatively younger than their classmates are more likely to have been diagnosed with [[ADHD]] (Caye et al., 2020)

> Although the prevalence of [[ADHD]] has not changed in this time period, large studies from the U.S. and Sweden indicate that [[ADHD]] is more likely to have been diagnosed in recent years, which reflects changes in administrative and clinical practices (Rydell et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018).

>  A meta-analysis of 19 studies encompassing over 150,000 U.S. Black youths under 18 years old reported an [[ADHD]] prevalence rate of 14 %. The authors concluded, "Black individuals are at

> [[ADHD]] is more common in males. A meta-analysis of parent ratings of symptoms in 29 studies with over 42,000 participants, and teacher ratings in 24 studies with over 56,000 participants, found a roughly two-to-one male/female ratio in youth (Willcutt, 2012).

> It found that spikes in nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and particulate matter were associated, respectively, with 47 %, 27 %, and 12 % increases in [[ADHD]] related hospital admissions in succeeding days. There were no significant differences between male and female adolescents, or between older and younger adolescents (Park et al., 2020).

A meta-analysis of nine European population studies encompassing 4826 mother-child pairs examined the relationship between exposure to Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) via breast milk in infancy and development of [[ADHD]]. No associations were found with [[ADHD]] in offspring (Forns et al., 2020).
