> [[ADHD]] can also be the result of rare single gene defects (Faraone and Larsson, 2018) or abnormalities of the chromosomes (Cederlof et al., 2014). When the DNA of 8000+ children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or [[ADHD]] and 5000 controls was analyzed, those with [[autism spectrum disorder|ASD]] and those with [[ADHD]] had an

> Family, twin, and DNA studies show that genetic and environmental influences are partially shared between [[ADHD]] and many other psychiatric disorders (e.g. [[schizophrenia]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[conduct disorder]], eating disorders, and [[substance use disorder]]s) and with somatic disorders (e.g. migraine and obesity) (Demontis et al., 2019) (Faraone and Larsson, 2018) (Ghirardi et al., 2018) (Lee et al., 2019a,b) (Lee et al., 2013) (Anttila et al., 2018; Tylee et al., 2018) (van Hulzen et al., 2017) (Vink and Schellekens, 2018) (Brikell et al., 2018) (Chen et al., 2019a) (Yao et al., 2019).

>  Very large studies of families suggest that [[ADHD]] shares genetic or familial causes with autoimmune diseases (Li et al., 2019), hypospadias (Butwicka et al., 2015), and intellectual disability (Faraone and Larsson, 2018).

> A more recent meta-analysis of 14 studies with over 17,000 children reported that higher blood lead levels were associated with quadrupled odds of [[ADHD]] (Nilsen and Tulve, 2020).

>  In a Taiwanese study of over 10,000 births, maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was associated with a 33 % greater likelihood of [[ADHD]] in their children (Chen et al., 2019b).

> Another study, examining 113,000 offspring from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and the Norwegian Patient Registry, including 2246 with [[ADHD]], found a dose-response relationship between maternal prenatal use of acetaminophen and [[ADHD]] (Ystrom et al., 2017).

> A nationwide study using the Danish national registers looked at 913,000 children born between 1997 and 2011. Prenatal exposure to the anti-epileptic drug valproate was associated with a 50 % greater risk of [[ADHD]]. No associations were found for other anti-epileptic drugs (Christensen et al., 2019).

> In a Norwegian registry study, 297 children with ADHD and 553 controls were randomly sampled from an eligible population of over 24,000. Children of mothers in the highest quintile of phthalate metabolite levels were three times more likely to have had [[ADHD]] as children compared with those in the bottom quintile, after adjusting for confounders, such as maternal age at delivery, sex of the child, maternal education, marital status, and prenatal maternal smoking (Engel et al., 2018).

> In a sample of 1139 children from the U.S. population, a tenfold increase in the organophosphate metabolite dimethyl alkylphosphate (DMAP) was associated with 55 % increase in the probability of having [[ADHD]]. Children with detectable levels of the most-commonly detected DMAP metabolite were twice as likely to have [[ADHD]] compared with those with undetectable levels (Bouchard et al., 2010).

> A Taiwan-wide longitudinal cohort study geo-linking over 16,000 mother-infant pairs to levels of air pollutants found no association between small particulate matter levels, sulphur dioxide levels, or nitrogen dioxide levels during gestation and [[ADHD]] diagnoses in the first eight years of their offspringsâ€™ lives. It did find 25 % greater odds for having [[ADHD]] with exposures to nitric oxide, a common traffic pollutant (Shih et al., 2020).
