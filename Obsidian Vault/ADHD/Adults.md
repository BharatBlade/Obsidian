> In adolescence and young adulthood, many individuals with a history of childhood ADHD continue to be impaired by the dis- order, although they often show reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity while retaining symptoms of inattention (Faraone et al., 2006).

> A meta-analysis of six studies with over 5300 participants esti- mated the prevalence of ADHD in adulthood to be 2.5 % (Simon et al., 2009).

>  meta-analysis of 20 studies encompassing 13 countries and seven regions/metropolitan areas, involving more than 26,000 participants, estimated that 2.8 % of adults meet criteria for ADHD (Fayyad et al., 2017).

> The lower prevalence in adults compared with youths is consistent with a meta-analysis of 21 studies with over 1600 participants showing that only about one in six youths with ADHD still meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD at age 25, and about half show signs of residual impair- ment (Faraone et al., 2006).

> A meta-analysis of nine studies with a total of over 32,000 older adults found a prevalence of 2.2 % based on ADHD rating scales, dropping to 1.5 % when limited to persons at least fifty years old. Yet a meta-analysis of seven studies with over 11.7 million par- ticipants based on ADHD clinical diagnoses, performed by the same team, reported a prevalence of only 0.2 % for persons at least fifty years old. A third meta-analysis performed by the same researchers, of four studies with over 9.2 million participants, found an ADHD treatment rate of only 0.02 % among persons at least fifty years old (Dobrosavljevic et al., 2020).
