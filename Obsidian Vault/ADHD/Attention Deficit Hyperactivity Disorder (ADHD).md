# Definition
$\qquad$Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as a chronic neurodevelopment disorder. It is described as a persistent, functionally debilitating pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity.

# Clinical Significance
## Symptoms
### Inattention
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1a. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily sidetracked).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones). 
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1h. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1i. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).
### Hyperactivity
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require remaining in place).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless.)
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2e. Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2f. Often talks excessively.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2g. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2h. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games, or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or receiving permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or take over what others are doing).
## Diagnostic Criteria
$\qquad$$\qquad$ A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2)
$\qquad$$\qquad$ B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).
$\qquad$$\qquad$ D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.
$\qquad$$\qquad$ E. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal).

## Presentations
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1. 314.01 (F90.2) Combined presentation: If both Criterion A1 (inattention) and Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) are met for the past 6 months.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2. 314.00 (F90.0) Predominantly inattentive presentation: If Criterion A1 (inattention) is met but Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is not met for the past 6 months.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 3. 314.01 (F90.1) Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation: If Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is met and Criterion A1 (inattention) is not met for the past 6 months.
## Associated Features
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1. Associated features may include low frustration tolerance, irritability, or mood lability.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2. academic or work performance is often impaired
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 3. By early adulthood, ADHD is associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt, primarily when comorbid with mood, conduct, or substance use disorders.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 4. Reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful control, or constraint; negative emotionality; and/or elevated novelty seeking
## Prevalence
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1. 5% of children
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2. 2.5% of adults
## Development and Course
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 1. In preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. 
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 2. Inattention becomes more prominent during elementary school.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 3. During adolescence, signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running and climbing) are less common and may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of jitteriness, restlessness, or impatience.
$\qquad$ $\qquad$ 4.  In adulthood, along with inattention and restlessness, impulsivity may remain problematic even when hyperactivity has diminished.

# Basic Science
## Neuroanatomy
children with ADHD present smaller volumes in different subcortical brain regions (i.e., nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen) and total intracranial volume, as well as decreased cortical surface area (mainly in frontal, cingulate, and temporal regions) and thickness (in the fusiform gyrus and temporal pole) [119]. Such alterations are not observed when restricting the analyses to adults and no effects of psychostimulants were found. Through adopting an independent component analysis of whole-brain morphometry images, associations of ADHD with reduced volumes in frontal lobes, striatum, and their interconnecting white matter microstructure were reported for both children and adults, supporting a role of the frontostriatal circuit regardless of age.
