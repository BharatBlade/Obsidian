# Abstract
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Symptoms of ADHD are classified as either Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity. Inattention symptoms include carelessness, distractibility, easily sidetracked, disorganization, misplaces necessary items often, and forgetfulness. Hyperactivity symptoms include restlessness, impulsivity, impatience, intrusiveness, inability to play quietly, and excessive talking. Symptoms usually start in childhood and may persist into adulthood if left untreated. The DSM-5 revised the ADHD diagnostic criteria regarding symptoms, age of onset, and symptom exclusivity. The number of symptoms required for diagnosis in either category (inattention or hyperactivity) has been reduced from 6 to 5 for older adolescents/adults. Age of onset has raised the age limit for initial symptom onset from 7 to 12. ADHD is often treated with medication, therapy, or a combination of both to help manage the symptoms and improve daily functioning for affected individuals. There is a rapidly growing body of research regarding all aspects of ADHD, both in the basic and clinical sciences. The goal of this review is to compound this information, including the anatomy, pathophysiology, and clinical presentations of ADHD.
