# Abstract:
[[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)]] is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as a chronic neurodevelopment disorder. It is described as a persistent, functionally debilitating pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity. There is a rapidly growing body of research regarding all aspects of ADHD, both in the basic and clinical sciences. The goal of this review is to compound this information, including the pathophysiology and clinical presentations of ADHD.

# Background:
$\qquad$[[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)]] is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as a chronic neurodevelopment disorder. It is described as a persistent, functionally debilitating pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity. Symptoms of ADHD are classified as either Inattention/Inattentive or Hyperactive/Hyperactivity. Inattention symptoms include carelessness, distractibility, easily sidetracked, disorganization, misplaces necessary items often, and forgetfulness. Hyperactivity symptoms include restlessness, impulsivity, impatience, intrusiveness, inability to play quietly, and excessive talking. In order for patients to be considered diagnosed with ADHD, multiple criteria are required. Symptoms must have started before age 12, presented in two or more settings, interfere with expected functioning, and can't be better attributed to another psychiatric illness. According to the DSM-V, for patients below 17 years old, six or more Inattention symptoms for at least six months are required to be diagnosed with "Predominantly Inattentive" presentation of ADHD. For patients below 17 years old, six or more Hyperactivity symptoms for at least six months are required to be diagnosed with "Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive" presentation of ADHD. If patients below 17 years old have at least six symptoms of both categories, then they are diagnosed with "Combined" presentation of ADHD.

# Pathophysiology:
> The first comes from studies of the performance of patients on psychological tests that study mental processes. The second comes from methods that directly examine brain structure or function with neuroimaging scans. Although many of these studies have found differences between groups of people who are and are not diagnosed with ADHD, the differences are typically small and do not dramatically differ between people with ADHD and those with other disorders. They are, therefore, not useful for diagnosing the disorder (Thome et al., 2012).

### [[Dopamine]]
> The dopaminergic system plays important roles in neuromodulation, such as motor control, motivation, reward, cognitive function, maternal, and reproductive behaviors. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, synthesized in both central nervous sys- tem and the periphery, that exerts its actions upon binding to G protein-coupled receptors. Dopamine receptors are widely expressed in the body and function in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems.

#### Synthesis
> he primary metabolic route involves a two-step synthesis in the cytosol. Tyrosine hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme) converts tyrosine to levodopa (L-DOPA) using tetrahydrobi- opterin, oxygen (O 2 ), and iron (Fe 2+ ) as cofactors. L-DOPA can then be converted to dopamine by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase), having pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor (Christenson et al. 1970). A minor synthesis pathway may also occur, in which p-tyramine can be converted to dopamine through Cytochrome P450 2D6 activity in the substantia nigra (Bromek et al. 2011; Fergu- son and Tyndale 2011). Following synthesis in dopaminergic neurons, dopamine is sequestered into the acidic lumen of synaptic vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) (Fig. 1a) (Eiden and Weihe 2011). In noradrener- gic and adrenergic cells, dopamine can be further converted into norepinephrine and epinephrine by sequential modifica- tions from dopamine Î²-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in the presence of O 2 , l-ascorbic acid, and s-adenosyl-l-methionine (Udenfriend and Wyngaarden 1956; Weinshilboum et al. 1971).

#### Receptor


#### Degradation
> The acidic environment of the synaptic vesicle lumen stabilizes dopamine and prevents oxidation (Guillot and Miller 2009). In a non-acidic microenvironment, dopamine is sensitive to oxidation or further metabolism by mono- amine oxidase B (MAO-B) into 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacet- aldehyde (DOPAL) which is preferentially converted into 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Catechol-O-Methyltrans- ferase (COMT) can further degrade DOPAC into homovan- illic acid (HVA), and can also directly convert dopamine into 3-methoxytyramine (Eisenhofer et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2011).

> Dopamine is sensitive to spontaneous, metal-catalyzed, and enzyme-catalyzed oxidation into electron-deficient quinones if it is not sequestered into vesicles or metabo- lized by MAO-B or COMT (Damier et al. 1996; Chen et al. 2011; Segura-Aguilar et al. 2014). Dopamine quinones are short-lived toxic species that readily form covalent bonds with cellular macromolecules (Stokes et al. 1999). The dopamine quinone can also undergo intramolecular cyclization to aminochrome which polymerizes and forms neuromelanin, the dark pigment contained in the dopamin- ergic neurons found in the substantia nigra pars compacta

> (Segura-Aguilar et al. 2014). Neuromelanin is formed in dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta due to the levels of VMAT-2 which are lower than mes- olimbic system (Segura-Aguilar et al. 2014), leading to an inverse relationship between VMAT-2 expression level and neuromelanin content in human midbrain dopaminergic neurons (Liang et al. 2004).
