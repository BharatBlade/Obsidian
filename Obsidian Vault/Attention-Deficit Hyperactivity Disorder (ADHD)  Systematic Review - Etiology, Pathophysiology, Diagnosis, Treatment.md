 
# Abstract:
[[ADHD]] is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) as a chronic neurodevelopment disorder. It is described as a persistent, functionally debilitating pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity. There is a rapidly growing body of research regarding all aspects of ADHD, both in the basic and clinical sciences. The goal of this review is to compound this information, including the pathophysiology and clinical presentations of ADHD.

# Background:
$\qquad$Symptoms of ADHD are classified as either Inattention/Inattentive or Hyperactive/Hyperactivity. Inattention symptoms include carelessness, distractibility, easily sidetracked, disorganization, misplaces necessary items often, and forgetfulness. Hyperactivity symptoms include restlessness, impulsivity, impatience, intrusiveness, inability to play quietly, and excessive talking. In order for patients to be considered diagnosed with ADHD, multiple criteria are required. Symptoms must have started before age 12, presented in two or more settings, interfere with expected functioning, and can't be better attributed to another psychiatric illness. According to the DSM-V, for patients below 17 years old, six or more Inattention symptoms for at least six months are required to be diagnosed with "Predominantly Inattentive" presentation of ADHD. For patients below 17 years old, six or more Hyperactivity symptoms for at least six months are required to be diagnosed with "Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive" presentation of ADHD. If patients below 17 years old have at least six symptoms of both categories, then they are diagnosed with "Combined" presentation of ADHD.

## Datasets and Methodology
<div style="margin-left: 8em">
This review discusses past studies that cover a wide variety of demographics, including children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with ADHD, or with ADHD symptoms. While many studies recruited participants and performed imaging studies and task evaluations, other studies often utilized datasets of previously taken imaging and clinical scoring tests. Here we discuss the methods used, including research datasets, clinical scoring, imaging techniques, and statistical analyses.
</div>


# Pathophysiology:
> The first comes from studies of the performance of patients on psychological tests that study mental processes. The second comes from methods that directly examine brain structure or function with neuroimaging scans. Although many of these studies have found differences between groups of people who are and are not diagnosed with ADHD, the differences are typically small and do not dramatically differ between people with ADHD and those with other disorders. They are, therefore, not useful for diagnosing the disorder (Thome et al., 2012).

## Anatomy
### Brain

#### [[Amygdala]]

[[ou2023.pdf]]
<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The amygdala, located in the temporal lobe, consists of several nuclei and modulates memory formation, fear, and anxiety.
</div>

[[suk2023.pdf]]
<div style="margin-left:8em">
Prior studies have shown associations between abnormalities of the amygdala and irritability. Irritability is associated with several psychiatric disorders, including ADHD. Suk et al took an additional step, exploring the associations of irritability with activation of the amygdala, and the associations of facial expression processing with activation of the amygdala. They recruited 59 children with disruptive mood and behavior disorder aged 10-18 with a self-reported Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) of at least 4. Major findings include increased activation in several regions of the brain in response to positive and negative facial expressions (happiness and fear). The regions of the brain were the right amygdala, right precuneus, right cingulate gyrus, bilateral cerebellum, right superior frontal gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus.
</div>

#### [[Basal Ganglia]]

[[Neuroanatomy, Basal Ganglia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The basal ganglia consist of several, adjacent structures deep to the cerebrum. These structures are the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra. The striatum contains the caudate, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and lenticular nuclei. The lenticular nuclei are the putamen, globus pallidus externus, and globus pallidus internus. 
</div>

[[tang2019.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
Tang et al investigated the association between basal ganglia morphology and motor response control. ADHD children aged 8-12 were evaluated via go/no-go tasks and shape-based morphometric analyses of T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE images using a 3T scanner. The results showed decreased volumes and inward deformation of the putamen and dorsal globus pallidus in male, ADHD children relative to male controls. The same findings were absent in female, ADHD children relative to female controls. There was also a positive correlation between decreased volume/inward deformation of these structures and poorer motor response control.  
</div>

[[shvarzman2022.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
Shvarzman et al used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate levels of iron deposition in the basal ganglia and their association with ADHD. They recruited ADHD children aged 8-12 for DTI of their brains, and also utilized brain-behavior analyses. They found that ADHD children had reduced iron in the bilateral limbic striatum. Lower tissue-iron levels in the bilateral limbic striatum correlated with anxious, depressive, and affective symptom severity.
</div>

[[cascone2023.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
Cascone et al used MRI and fMRI to assess intrinsic dopamine availability in the basal ganglia and thalamus of ADHD children aged 8-12. The ADHD-only participants also underwent a crossover methylphenidate challenge. They found that increased iron in the putamen was negatively associated with successful response inhibition regardless of ADHD-status. During their crossover challenge, they also found that higher putamen and caudate iron levels positively correlated with better response to methylphenidate. This was seen in the ADHD children's improved task performance with methylphenidate.
</div>
#### [[Caudate]]

[[Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The caudate nuclei, which is located in the striatum in the basal ganglia, are subcortical structures lateral to the thalamus. Their neurons primarily consist of GABAergic medium spiny neurons that inhibit other basal ganglia structures.

[[greven2015.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
Greven et al conducted a cross-sectional study with the goal of detecting associations with brain structure volume with ADHD. They used brain MRI data from the Dutch NeuroIMAGE sample dataset of ADHD children and adult patients, unaffected siblings, and typically developing control individuals. They were measuring volumes of the whole brain, along with the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, globus pallidus, hippocampus, thalamus, and brainstem. The findings in ADHD patients consisted of a 2.5% decrease in total brain volume of ADHD patients, 3% decrease in total gray matter volume. Unaffected siblings had increased total brain volume relative to ADHD patients, but still decreased total brain volume relative to typically developing controls. Age appeared to be negatively associated with caudate and putamen volumes in typically developing controls. However, in ADHD patients and their unaffected siblings, age had no statistically significant association with caudate/putamen volumes.

[[dang2016.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
Dang et al aimed to clarify the relationship between caudate asymmetry and ADHD symptoms. T1-weighted MRI scans of adults aged 18-35 were analyzed for caudate asymmetry. The ADHD score from the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) was used to assess attentional problems, while impulsivity, was measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, a self-report measure. The findings suggest that larger right relative to left caudate volumes correlate with higher attentional impulsiveness and worse ADHD scores on the TOVA.
</div>

[[yang2017.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
Yang et al examined the dorsal caudate's functional connectivity with other parts of the brain in children with ADHD, using resting-state functional connectivity data from MRI scans. The results showed the dorsal caudate's positive connectivity with prefrontal areas, cingulate cortex, and temporal lobe, as well as its negative connectivity with precuneus, occipital cortices, and cerebellum. A correlation between the left dorsal caudate's connection to the left inferior frontal gyrus and severity of ADHD was also found.

[[damiani2020.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The study aimed to clarify the relationship between subcortical regions and ADHD. Whole-brain voxel-wise resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) was measured via fMRI of ADHD children aged 7 to 18. Total ADHD, Hyperactivity and Inattention scores were collected using the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale Revised, Long Version, in order to evaluate associations between rsFC changes and ADHD. Structures of focus were the caudate, amygdala, putamen, pallidum and hippocampus. The study found that the caudate nucleus showed increased rsFC with the anterior cingulate and right insula. They also found that the increased rsFC of the caudate nucleus positively correlated with ADHD symptomatology.
</div>

[[mamiya2022.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The study aimed to understand how changes in glutamate and GABA levels in the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens occur during attention control tasks. ADHD adults aged 31-51 years old were recruited for MPRAGE T1-weighted imaging and MRS scans while performing attention control tasks. During these tasks, smaller increases in glutamate and GABA were seen in ADHD patients compared to those without ADHD. These smaller increases also were found to positively correlate with worsening performance in the attention control tasks for ADHD patients.

[[wu2022.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
This study aimed to understand the neural mechanisms of emotional dysregulation (ED) in children with ADHD and MDD. Participants included 22 ADHD and 21 MDD patients, all with clinical ED. These patients underwent resting-state functional connectivity analysis, voxel-based morphometry, and diffusion tensor imaging analysis, along with clinical rating scales for ED, ADHD, and MDD. The results showed increased rsFC in the cerebellum and supramarginal gyrus, decreased rsFC in the right supplementary motor area and right lateral parietal area, lower gray matter (GM) volume in the SMG, and both RSFC and GM were correlated with clinical rating scale scores for all patients with ED due to ADHD or MDD. 
</div>

#### [[Cingulate Gyrus]]

[[bauer2016.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The study aimed to investigate glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of adults with ADHD and healthy controls using single-voxel proton MRS on a 3T scanner. Results showed increased ACC glutamate levels in ADHD patients, and a positive correlation between glutamate levels in the ACC and severity of hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms in ADHD patients.
</div>

[[bonath2016.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The current study utilized voxel-based morphometry with DARTEL to measure regional gray matter volumes. The Culture Fair Intelligence Test and the d2-test were used to assess selective attention performance. Together these were analyzed to find correlations between gray matter abnormalities and ADHD symptoms. The researchers found that subjects with ADHD exhibited reduced GM volume in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), occipital cortex, bilateral hippocampus/amygdala, and widespread regions of the cerebellum in ADHD patients. GM volume in the ACC was negatively associated with test scores of selective inattention.

[[fernandez-jaen2016.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) 3´UTR genotype and the cingulate cortical thickness in ADHD patients. Using brain MRIs from 46 ADHD patients homozygous for the 10-repeat allele and 52 ADHD patients with either 0 or 1 copies of the allele, researchers found that the homozygous individuals had increased thickness in the right cingulate gyrus and right Brodmann Area 24.

[[zhan2017.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
This study aimed to examine the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) of children diagnosed with ADHD-combined type (ADHD-C). The ADHD-C patients underwent Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and parent-based, clinical DSM-IV scoring of ADHD symptoms. They found a disconnected functional network between the sgACC, and the occipital lobe and cerebellum. Results also showed disrupted white matter in the subgenual cingulum bundle (sgCB), increased variability of spontaneous brain activity in the sgACC, and higher radial diffusivity in the sgCB. From their analyses, they found a negative correlation between increased clincal scores with sgACC spontaneous brain activity.

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The study examined dynamic regional cerebral blood flow alterations of ADHD children using event-related Arterial spin labeling (ASL) scanning. 17 healthy controls and 20 children with ADHD were scanned on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner during a go/no-go task. The right anterior cingulate cortex, frontopolar cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann Areas 32, 10, 11) activation was increased in ADHD children during the attention task. The findings suggest that ADHD children over-activated these regions to compensate for the increased attention demands.

#### [[Corpus Callosum]]

[[luders2016.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
This study investigated whether there is a link between ADHD symptoms in adults over 60 years old and the thickness of their corpus callosum. Results indicated that in males the thickness of anterior third, anterior/posterior midbody, isthmus, and splenium of the corpus callosum was negatively correlated with inattention and hyperactivity. Females exhibited a positive correlation between the thickness of the rostral body of the corpus callosum and hyperactivity.
</div>

[[el-hadad2021.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
This study explored the changes in the white matter of the corpus callosum and their association with ADHD symptoms. In a case-control study conducted at Menoufia University Hospitals, researchers recruited ADHD children aged 3-14. Both behavioral and cognitive functions were evaluated by studying brain Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) in correlation with radiological data from both groups. The results showed that the isthmus of the corpus callosum had a mean FA value lower in the ADHD group, indicating reduced white matter consistency.

#### [[Globus Pallidus]]

[[dupont2022.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
In this study, the researchers aimed to investigate associations between  functional brain connectivity profiles and sex differences in ADHD adults.   Participants underwent structural MRI and rsfMRI on a 3 T full body MR scanner and seed-based connectivity analysis of the external globus pallidus (GPe) was performed. Their results showed that male ADHD patients had decreased functional connectivity compared to female ADHD patients, specifically between GPe and left middle temporal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. They also found that ADHD males with comorbid depression showed decreased GPe FC with the occipital cortex.

[[nickel2017.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The study aimed to compare amygdala and hippocampus volumes using MRIs of ADHD adults and controls. Clinician-administered diagnostic interviews and self-report scales were also collected. Results showed that there was no significant difference in volume of either region. However, they found hyperactivity in specifically ADHD patients negatively correlated with left amygdala volumes.
</div>

#### [[Hypothalamus]]

[[ma2011.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The association between the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and ADHD in non-stress states. Participants were male children with ADHD aged 6 to 14. ADHD was delineated into three sub-groups: ADHD-predominantly inattention type (ADHD-I), ADHD-predominantly hyperactive impulsive type (ADHD-HI), and ADHD-combined type (ADHD-C). The levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) were evaluated per morning (8:00 am). ADHD patients overall showed decreased cortisol relative to the control group. The ADHD-HI group specifically showed even further decreased cortisol relative to the other two groups (ADHD-I and ADHD-C). No associations regarding ACTH were found.

#### [[Putamen]]

[[max2002.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The study aimed to examine the association between focal stroke lesions in children and ADHD/ADHD traits. Participants underwent psychiatric assessments including the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and brain MRIs. Of the patients with ADHD/ADHD traits, the densest area of overlapping lesions was in the posterior ventral putamen. Of the remaining patients (no ADHD/ADHD traits), none of them had lesions in the posterior ventral putamen. They found that those with lesions in this region were more likely to have ADHD.

[[wellington2006.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The aim of this study is to investigate differences in putamen volumes among  ADHD combined subtype male children with psychopathic traits and controls. Using past MRI scans, the putamens in both groups are analyzed but no local volume differences were found. However, a reversal of symmetry in the putamen is discovered in which children with ADHD tend to have smaller left relative to right putamens compared to their control counterparts who have smaller right relative to left putamens.
</div>

[[cao2009.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
The study aimed to explore differences in putamen functional connectivity between medication-naïve ADHD children and typically developing children. Using seed-based correlation analyses in resting-state fMRI data, it was found in the controls (TD children) that there was positive putamen functional connectivity with the bilateral sensorimotor areas, prefrontal cortex, insula, superior temporal gyrus, and subcortical regions. Negative putamen functional connectivity was observed in the bilateral parietal and occipital cortices. Negative putamen FC was also seen in the frontal and middle temporal cortices and cerebellum. ADHD children relative to controls had, increased left putamen FC with the right globus pallidus/thalamus, decreased left putamen positive FC with the right frontal and limbic regions, decreased left putamen negative FC with the right cerebellum and right temporal lobe, and decreased right putamen negative FC with the left cerebellum and right precuneus.

[[xu2017.pdf]]

<div style="margin-left: 8em">
In this study, researchers investigated a specific genetic variant, rs945270 (reported to affect putamen volume), linked with increased symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 14-year-old adolescents. They used a large sample size of 1834 children, and analyzed ADHD symptoms via their Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). They also analyzed the Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses of putamen activation by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the Stop Signal (SST, for assessing response inhibition) and monetary incentive delay (MID, for assessing reward sensitivity) tasks. They found that the C-allele at rs945270 was negatively correlated with symptom scores, especially hyperactivity. However in males, the c-allele was negative correlated with putamen activity during successful response inhibition, regardless of ADHD symptoms. In females, the c-allele was positive correlated with bilateral (right more than left) putamen activity during reward anticipation. Right putamen activation negatively correlated with ADHD symptoms.

## Physiology

### [[Dopamine]]
> The [[dopamine|dopaminergic]] system plays important roles in neuromodulation, such as motor control, motivation, reward, cognitive function, maternal, and reproductive behaviors. [[Dopamine]] is a neurotransmitter, synthesized in both central nervous sys- tem and the periphery, that exerts its actions upon binding to G protein-coupled receptors. Dopamine receptors are widely expressed in the body and function in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. 

[[klein2018.pdf#page=1&selection=36,0,39,91|klein2018, page 1]]

#### Synthesis
> he primary metabolic route involves a two-step synthesis in the cytosol. [[Tyrosine hydroxylase]] (the rate-limiting enzyme) converts [[tyrosine]] to [[levodopa (L-DOPA)]] using tetrahydrobiopterin, oxygen (O 2 ), and iron (Fe 2+ ) as cofactors. [[Levodopa (L-DOPA)|L-DOPA]] can then be converted to [[dopamine]] by aromatic [[l-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase)]], having pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor (Christenson et al. 1970). A minor synthesis pathway may also occur, in which p-[[tyramine]] can be converted to [[dopamine]] through [[Cytochrome P450 2D6]] activity in the [[substantia nigra]] (Bromek et al. 2011; Ferguson and Tyndale 2011). Following synthesis in [[dopamine|dopaminergic]] neurons, [[dopamine]] is sequestered into the acidic lumen of synaptic vesicles via the [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2)]] (Fig. 1a) (Eiden and Weihe 2011). In [[norepinephrine|noradrenergic]] and [[epinephrine|adrenergic]] cells, [[dopamine]] can be further converted into [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]] by sequential modifications from [[dopamine β-hydroxylase]] and [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase]] in the presence of O 2 , l-ascorbic acid, and s-adenosyl-l-methionine (Udenfriend and Wyngaarden 1956; Weinshilboum et al. 1971).

[[klein2018.pdf#page=3&selection=66,1,120,32|klein2018, page 3]]

#### Receptor


#### Degradation
> The acidic environment of the synaptic vesicle lumen stabilizes [[dopamine]] and prevents oxidation (Guillot and Miller 2009). In a non-acidic microenvironment, [[dopamine]] is sensitive to oxidation or further metabolism by [[monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B)]] into [[3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL)]] which is preferentially converted into [[3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)]] by the enzyme [[aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)]]. [[Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT)]] can further degrade [[DOPAC]] into [[homovanillic acid (HVA)]], and can also directly convert [[dopamine]] into 3-methoxytyramine (Eisenhofer et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2011).

[[klein2018.pdf#page=3&selection=121,0,134,6|klein2018, page 3]]

> [[Dopamine]] is sensitive to spontaneous, metal-catalyzed, and enzyme-catalyzed oxidation into electron-deficient quinones if it is not sequestered into vesicles or metabolized by [[Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B)|MAO-B]] or [[Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT)|COMT]] (Damier et al. 1996; Chen et al. 2011; Segura-Aguilar et al. 2014). [[Dopamine]] quinones are short-lived toxic species that readily form covalent bonds with cellular macromolecules (Stokes et al. 1999). The [[dopamine]] quinone can also undergo intramolecular cyclization to aminochrome which polymerizes and forms neuromelanin, the dark pigment contained in the [[dopaminergic|dopamine]] neurons found in the [[substantia nigra]] pars compacta

[[klein2018.pdf#page=3&selection=145,0,157,30|klein2018, page 3]]

> (Segura-Aguilar et al. 2014). Neuromelanin is formed in [[dopaminergic|dopamine]] neurons of [[substantia nigra]] pars compacta due to the levels of [[Vesicular MonoAmine Transporter 2 (VMAT2)|VMAT-2]] which are lower than [[mesolimbic]] system (Segura-Aguilar et al. 2014), leading to an inverse relationship between [[Vesicular MonoAmine Transporter 2 (VMAT2)|VMAT-2]] expression level and neuromelanin content in human midbrain [[dopamine|dopaminergic]] neurons (Liang et al. 2004).
